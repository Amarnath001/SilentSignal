## streamlit-frontend

The folder `streamlit-frontend` is the previous Python/Streamlit UI that used to live at `silent_signal/frontend/`.

Current production frontend is the React app in `frontend-react/` deployed as a Static Site on Render. The archived Streamlit frontend is no longer used or deployed.

If you need to restore it temporarily, move it back to `silent_signal/frontend/` in a feature branch. Do not re-introduce it to production without a clear plan.
