Person A: Why didn't you answer my calls?
Person B: I was in a meeting, I texted you that I'd call back later.
Person A: You always have excuses. If you really cared about me, you'd make time.
Person B: I do care about you, but I can't always answer immediately.
Person A: You're being selfish. After everything I do for you, this is how you treat me?
Person B: I'm not trying to be selfish, I just had work obligations.
Person A: You're making me feel like I don't matter to you.
Person B: That's not true, you do matter to me.
Person A: Then prove it. Stop making excuses and start prioritizing me.
