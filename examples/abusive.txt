Person A: Where were you last night?
Person B: I told you, I was at my sister's house.
Person A: That's not what I heard. You're lying to me again.
Person B: I'm not lying, I was there the whole time.
Person A: You're always making things up. You're crazy, you know that?
Person B: I'm not crazy, I'm telling you the truth.
Person A: If you loved me, you wouldn't lie to me like this. You're making me question everything.
Person B: I do love you, and I'm not lying.
Person A: You're being dramatic. You always overreact to everything I say.
Person B: I'm not overreacting, I'm just trying to explain.
Person A: You're too sensitive. You need to grow up and stop being so childish.
Person B: I'm not being childish, I'm just confused about why you don't believe me.
Person A: You're pushing my buttons. You don't want to make me angry, do you?
Person B: No, I don't want to make you angry.
Person A: Good. Because if you keep this up, you'll be sorry. I'm warning you.
Person B: I'm scared when you talk like this.
Person A: Good. You should be scared.
